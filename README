pyc2py
======
Pyc2py is a python decompiler: you can use it to retrieve the source code 
when having the bytecode file (*.pyc).

It is currently beta software and was only tested with python2.6 bytecode 
files.

Usage:
./main.py <path_to_your_pyc_file> > output.py

Important note
==============
In order to simplify its design, pyc2py uses python introspection features.
Thanks to this, bytecode analysis is limited to function and class methods.
As a consequence, the first step of the analysis is the import of the module 
implemented in the *.pyc input file; if this module imports other modules, 
these additional modules must be present in the "python path" (in either form,
'.py' or '.pyc'), otherwise this preliminary import will fail.
